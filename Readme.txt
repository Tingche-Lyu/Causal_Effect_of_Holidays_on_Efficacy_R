This is the final project of Empirical Econ Analysis (Fall I 2022) for Team 36, consisting of 
Maggie Lundberg, Tingche Lyu, Niyati Mody, Vladislav Stanojevic, and Kala Nandini Uppala.

In this project, we focused on factory worker efficiency, and our original dataset is called 
"factory.csv," which is a dataset from Kaggle.

The R file contains all the codes from cleaning to causal inference. The basic model is OLS, 
and the advanced technique is panel fixed effect.

Our final deliverable is the PowerPoint. In the slides, We explain the motivation, literature 
review, EDA, model comparisons, findings, etc. One will be able to understand the details we 
want to explain by reading the notes below each slide.
